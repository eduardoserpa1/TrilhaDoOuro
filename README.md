#  Dynamic algorithms with ternary trees
## **Problem:** _Finding the highest sum path in nxn matrices starting from the lower left cell to the upper right cell_


### **Solutions**
- Recursive without optimization 
- Recursive optimized
- Non-recursive optimized

### How to run
the solutions above are runned in order when you execute the algorithm, so you have first to compile the java program like this

```bash
javac Ouro.java
```

then

```bash
java Ouro <file_path>
```
this comand will run the three cases, in order.
